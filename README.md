# Bounce
A java program that bounces objects around a window
• It was my first attempt at a java program, the program allows you to create shapes that bouce around the window and can change color.
• The shape objects I created are Xrectangle, square, rectangle, oval and nested shape (objects bouncing inside this object).
• Additionally you can choose shape size, fill color and border color as well as path type of bounce or fall.
• I used graphics painter and animation viewer to show these objects.
• This project showed me how to create a basic java program and integrate various objects to create a responsive and interactive program.
